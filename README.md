## Goal
Purpose of this study is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens and Creating a Top level summary of the Study results for the execurtives.
## Results

## Analysis
1. Capomulin and Ramicane drugs have been used to treat the highest number of mice.
2. A good ratio of Male and Female mice have been included
3. The Correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84 using Capomulin drug treatment, which indicates a Strong Positive correlation between the variables. This means when mouse weight increases the average tumor volume tends to increase as well and viceversa. But this does not mean causation.It is not meant to say that the mouse weight causes changes in tumor volume or viceversa. It only indicates there is a consistent relationship between Weight and average tumor volume.
